# P1---projectile-launch
Project 1 - Iteration one
A 2D Physics-Based Game made with Godot by Janardhen Jayavel.

# Project Report
## Reflection
Completing this iteration one gave me a satisfaction that I finally did it. But, it was really very hard for me to do each and every step. I had difficulties in getting a suitable png for my project. I had difficulties in using git actions and many more. So,I am planning to meet with my professor during office hours this week to get my doubts cleared. I am also scared that this is just the beginning of the semester and how am I gonna perform in upcoming projects. I learnt many things than the first Tutorial project especially using the physics kit and applying Physics motion in the Godot engine  and I strive to give my best in future projects.
