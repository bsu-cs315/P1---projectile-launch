# Project Report

## Reflection
 This project was nice to use the sounds and grpahics in 2D. The video that published the second half solution to the iteration 1 really helped a lot. It solved my doubts. I couldn't fulfill all criteria's for an A grade. I feel sorry for that but then as my professor Dr.G said, its all about learning. I will learn something in the next video. I am looking forward for my next iteration in the upcoming week.
