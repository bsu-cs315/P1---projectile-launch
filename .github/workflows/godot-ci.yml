# Workflow to publish Godot HTML5 games to GitHub Pages
#
# This script assumes that the project itself is in a subdirectory "project". This 
# folder structure frees up the root of the repository to be used for non-project
# files, such as the README, build folder, or raw assets folder.
#
# Make sure your project is configured for Web export
# to the path `build/web`.
